- multiple wrapped sentences appear as separate paragraphs, this looks rather weird. for example:
!wrapped line as separate paragraph.png!
here the word ""information"" is part of the previous sentence, but the spacing between the lines makes it look like it is a separate paragraph.
note that this affects multiple sentences, including ones near the bottom of the page.
- incomplete sentence
{quote}
... you can play the, then downloading the minecraft launcher ...

after ""play the"" a word seems to be missing. though the word ""downloading"" might not be grammatically correct if ""play"" is not a gerund either.
- the sentence ""demo mode is available to any mojang account holder who is logged into the minecraft launcher but does not own a copy of minecraft."" seems to be outdated and duplicated. just a few lines below it says ""the demo mode is available to any mojang or microsoft account that is logged into the launcher but does not own a purchased copy of minecraft"" (that sentence is missing a period at the end though).

!image-2021-12-03-10-10-26-016.png|thumbnail!

 

 

i understand that your team is planning to migrate to microsoft accounts, but ideally you should make the mojang layout useable as there is no other way for me to locate my gift code (transaction id) for an account which was purchased over 8 years ago without having access to the old version of this webpage. some users may need to provide gift card codes from years prior to support to migrate to a microsoft account, which is only accessible via this layout.

 

the mojang account layout may also be necessary for the migration of legacy premium minecraft accounts (prior to mojang accounts) to mojang accounts.

 

if you plan to phase out the account.mojang.com website entirely, i suggest you make these gift card codes available in another location, namely minecraft.net.

 

all in all, the ability to find gift card codes existed prior to this change and i would appreciate it wholly if this change was reverted or some other method of finding my gift card code from 8 years ago, which may have even been thrown out after use rather than retained, as it was not of my knowledge at the time that gift card codes can be used to verify that you are the owner of the account.

i realized some people might not know that legacy migration has actually started so here's a tweet from a mojang employee showing that they have started it: [https://twitter.com/mojang_ined/status/1463076160745660418]

 

also i find it weird how it removes the ability to change your skin and password when it shows the prompt.

 

another thing, it is possible that my account isn't actually eligible since ined said that it was small number of legacy accounts that got the prompt. but if this is true i don't think the prompt to migrate should even show if they can migrate.

in terms of these problems
 # we need an *overhaul in design and layout-ing* that would be similar to facebook or youtube or other familiar sites that people mostly use.
 # we need to add more features in these websites
 ## for instance, minecraft feedback site (feedback.minecraft.net) is powered by votes like {color:#ff0000}upvote, or downvote{color}. instead, use a *like button or a dislike button* like youtube but there is no video.
 ### change the *layout* to make it look *like* *facebook or youtube*. you scroll down endlessly seeing random popular suggestions and you can like or dislike it whatever you want.
 ### add stuff like youtube did, *add a 30 sec no audio, video-only* presentation feature so that the devs and the voters will understand what did the suggestion meant to be.
 ## bugs website (bugs.mojang.com) is too complicated to use for a kid reporting a bug. yes, minecraft is targeted for kids and mostly kids play it, then they saw the splash text: report bugs at bugs.mogang.com!, then proceeded to that website.
 ### the first thing they see is a login page like facebook. {color:#57d9a3}very good!{color}
 ### then they went to dashboard. wait what? what is a{color:#de350b} dashboard?{color} i am expecting a *home page like facebook and youtube.* i want it to look like facebook. you can see the bugs all in one glance. *""post a bug""* not {color:#de350b}""create an issue""{color} which will be overcomplicated to use at all.
 ### {color:#de350b}the notifs are through email{color}. bruh, maybe next edition of this website, *make an app or notify through browser* like youtube and facebook did. so that i will not miss out an update about my reported bugs.

i know you're probably not the most ideal recipient for this, but i've looked around and don't have any other choice.
in trying to buy minecraft bedrock edition, i've been fought at every single corner. from ""login.live.com refused to connect"" to ""we can't complete your purchase right now, try again later"".
i finally broke through, and was faced with another bloody wall. to complete the purchase, i need to enter an account address. problem is, i live in australia, but the dropdown menu to select country or region is locked to america, as though they're the only people that matter in the world. i entered a fake address (maybe not the most ethical option, but i wasn't given another choice) and proceeded. then it told me ""the region in which your payment option was issued and your store region need to match."" i wasn't given a choice, they couldn't have matched if i wanted them to.

recently, a user told me, that one of those custom heads don't work anymore.

and now i wonder why.

based on this tweet: [https://twitter.com/dinnerbone/status/464414369452142592]

i thought those skinfiles are never removed if they're on the mojang servers once.

so i started a validation on all 40000 custom heads and found some missing textures:

at that time, another head was reported, but it worked again one day later. it's not in the list above.

so: to validate things again, i started a second validation on all 40.000 skins today and had the following result:

so here's the problem: basically, skinfiles are gone from the mojang servers temporary and reappear later. but why?

what's happening there? i can't guess of any reason beside some kind of file transfer to other servers why this is happening, so please help me out.

the community decorating with those custom heads rely on those heads which never change ;)

the text field for changing the profile name in the ""change profile name"" section of https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/profile appears to always update the error state (e.g. whether profile name is invalid) when an availability api response is received.

when you type quickly (or have a bad internet connection) it could therefore happen that an api response updates the error text despite you alreading having changed the entered name in the meantime.

h3. reproduction steps
# open https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/profile
# in the text field for changing your profile name, hold down the {{a}} key for a few seconds, then quickly afterwards press the {{space}} key
(x) for a short moment the error message says ""your profile name can only include letters, numbers and underscores."" before switching to the outdated (and incorrect) ""this profile name already exists.""

the same also can be seen where after quickly inserting an invalid character behind a valid name, for a short moment the error message says the name is invalid, but then being cleared and the website (erroneously) claiming that the name is valid.

when receiving a response from the api, verify that it is still relevant for the current input.","minecraft.net ""change profile name"" updates error message with outdated api response"

407255,normal,4,bug,"_we have had enough_. the system has been in effect for two months, and it has already failed miserably. people are getting banned left and right, and there are so many issues with the entire thing.

first of all, the bans are *permanent, and cannot be removed or negotiated*. the whole concept of permanent bans on things like minecraft where you pay money for the product and save up lots of progress is just stupid. people change. any moderator on minecraft can just decide to ban you forever and you can't play multiplayer (unless you're on xbox, then you can't play at all) without notice, which bring us to our second issue.

when an account is banned, no reason for the ban is given. *no. reason.* what in the nether, mojang?!?! this is beyond stupid. if someone is banned for no reason, the user can't improve as a person and it gives moderators the ability to just ban people whenever they feel like it.

third of all, the grounds for getting banned are extremely vague. mojang _claims_ that the bans are only given out ""to the worst offenders"", however, like stated before, innocent people are getting banned all the time for no reason. the grounds for getting banned include hate speech, sexual content and soliciting improper content, real life threats, exposing the personal information of others, posting links to malicious software, impersonating staff, cheating/exploits, and general commercial spamming.

what?? this is so vague! there are so many issues with this!

what counts as hate speech? what counts as impersonating staff? which staff? mojang staff? server staff? where does it become too sexual? what is ""improper content""? what counts as commercial, or spamming?

the fourth issue is that the concept of universal bans makes no sense. if someone did something bad enough that mojang claims they would ban someone for, wouldn't/shouldn't they already be banned from xbox live or playstation network? *minecraft is a game, not a social platform.*

fifth is that they apply everywhere. you might be saying to yourself ""well duh, you already stated that"", but bear with me here. different servers have different rules. something that would be considered fine on one server could warrant moderator action on another. the system does not take context into account.

sixth and finally is that *we don't know how the game is being moderated*. do they have player reports? do moderators monitor servers posing as regular players? do players' chat logs get saved and manually reviewed or reviewed by a bot, if so that would raise serious privacy concerns.

the only reason mojang is doing this is because when something bad happens on the game, news media goes crazy and gives the game bad press. since mojang only really cares about money, they hurt their playerbase to five themselves a good look.

*what should we do?*

i don't know yet. personally, i will be taking a break from minecraft until mojang decides to listen to their players, and i encourage you to do the same. if this post blows up, we could have like a week or two of not playing out of protest for the horrible moderation to really put a message out there. i will probably make a follow-up post if this post takes off either on my profile, another subreddit, or this subreddit (if i don't get banned).

another good idea would to send mojang a message whether it be directly contacting them, not making purchases, or taking a break from the game entirely, like me.

either way, spread the word! copy/paste to your friends, spread awareness, sign petitions, do whatever you can!

*what should mojang do?*

first of all, _get rid of the current system until you have a new and better one in place to prevent further damage._

*bans should not last until* 

*the end of all time*, maybe a few months at most. if it's enough to warrant a permanent ban from minecraft, it's enough to warrant a ban from xbox live/playstation network.

*bans should have a reason attached*. if you don't know what you did wrong, how can you become better as a person? not having a reason for bans also allows moderators to ban people for no reason.

*hold moderators accountable for their actions*. if a moderator takes action falsely against users multiple times, hold them accountable! their actions have consequences, just like regular players!

*bans should be able to be appealed*. unfair bans are unfortunately very common, and if someone does anything slightly wrong, they have pretty much their entire minecraft access revoked. people should be able to disagree and speak their opinion.

*bans should not be universal*. a good idea for this is have it so realm and sever owners could opt into a program which has it so players are only banned from realms and servers that are opted in. this ties into what was previously mentioned about how different servers have different rules. minecraft should be about what you want your adventure to look like, not what mojang wants it to look like.

*put yourself in the players' shoes*. imagine you said something slightly offensive on a private realm with you and your friend. you get banned from minecraft. in the best case, you can't access multiplayer anymore and you lose all of your maps, progress in servers, and the ability to play minecraft with other people. do you realize how devastating that is to some people?

bottom line: mojang, fix your system. people, protest the current moderation system. also congratulations if you made it this far.

tl;dr the current moderation system in minecraft is awful and needs serious reform. send mojang a message whether it be contacting them directly, not making purchases, or taking a break from the game entirely.",remove moderation.

h3. difference between normal text and links not clear enough
normal text uses {{#333333}} as color, links use {{#018944}}. when the links are on their own (e.g. in a list) they can easily be seen. however, when they appear within text spotting them is slightly more difficult and depends on the default font size of the browser.

especially in microsoft edge (whose default font appears to be thinner than firefox one's) spotting links can be difficult:
!edge (87.0.664.66 64 bit) not visited link.png|thumbnail!
(in this screenshot the word ""here"" at the end of the sentence is a link)

h3. nearly no difference between {{visited}} link and text
when a link has been visited already (css style {{a:visited}}) it gets the color {{#002412}} which is way too similar to the normal text color {{#333333}}. this makes differentiating visited links from normal text nearly impossible.

i am a pocket edition user.i like to play minecraft.a bug that makes this game irritating is that after signing in to the microsoft, the game works normally like you have servers available and you can buy and download texture packs,worlds, emotes but after quitting the game the game probably don't save the changes i made. the game acts like i have no network available even after the network speed is normal and now i can't even use servers it shows coming soon and the game shows that there is no emotes even after i equipped these emotes earlier. and the game deactivates all texture packs even after i activated these texture packs earlier.and finally the game replaces the skin i had earlier to the random skins i had long time ago and the 1.16.200.51 beta menu screen that was in black and white colour will be replaced in to the normally coloured screen for 1.16.200.51 beta after the bug comes into play.i can fix this bug by uninstalling and reinstalling the game,but after quitting the game the bug will return again. i can't do anything about this because i have to uninstall and reinstall again and again to just play and enjoy this game properly so please i am begging you that fix this bug.also i can't even view my achievements because of this annoying bug, again i am begging you that fix this bug.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏{quote}","can't access servers, marketplace and achievements after signing in"

i have for quite a long time had a mojang account with a giftcode redeemed onto it without actually having claimed any profile name on the account, as i've been unsure what to name it.
this was possible by simply entering a valid giftcode on https://account.mojang.com/redeem while being signed in to your account, and then immediately closing out of it without choosing any profile name. 
you were then prompted with a notice every time you logged into your account on account.mojang.com stating that you had an uncreated profile on your account, and whenever you had decided on your profile name you could just click on the link in the notice and create your minecraft account with that profile name. 

on december 1st this prompt, along with many other features (including the create profile page that the notice linked to) was removed from account.mojang.com, due to what i assume was related to the update on minecraft.net which made new users sign up with microsoft accounts instead of mojang accounts.

as i assumed you just moved the create profile page over to minecraft.net i started looking over there for it, and after a while i stumbled across this page https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/set-profile-name , which seemed to be the new equivalent of the old create profile page on account.mojang.com.
when i went to create my profile i was, to my suprise, met by the message ""something went wrong! try again"" however, as shown here:
https://gyazo.com/569b3e1f5fa4c275376b51ba9221dd76

i had heard several other people were using this page just fine with their newly created microsoft accounts, so i came to the conclusion that i must be getting this error only because i'm trying to create a profile on a mojang account instead of a microsoft account, as i'm sure my redeemed giftcode is completely valid.

to make sure you hadn't just reset the account bindings of these giftcodes i tried to redeem my giftcode on a new microsoft account instead, but i was unable to do this as it said that the giftcode had already been redeemed. 

i don't know if you've invalidated these redeemed giftcodes completely or if you're just not allowing mojang accounts to use this new create profile page, but this essentially renders my giftcode useless, and this is a very serious issue as i, along with i suppose many others, have spent money on these giftcodes that we now can't use to create our minecraft profiles that we paid for.

i hope you understand what i mean so that this can be reverted or fixed in some way as soon as possible. ",new api/site switchover invalidated giftcodes that were redeemed onto mojang accounts

essentially when someone goes to purchase minecraft by pressing the, ""buy minecraft"" button in the photo, ""minecraft0"" gets directed to another browser titled, ""mojang account update"" (found in minecraft1 file) the two buttons work perfectly, they go to where they need to go. although, when someone clicks on, ""registration form"" they get directed onto another page to sign into either microsoft or mojang. in this scenario, we've been signing in with microsoft. we've succeeded in signing in with microsoft and have done the steps. afterward, we have been directed to this new page (found in minecraft2) after we have chosen the, ""buy minecraft"" button then we get directed back into the browser in minecraft0, and again, we click the green buy minecraft button, but this time we are signed in with microsoft. then it starts all over again. we're back at the mojang account update page. we followed the steps again to purchase minecraft but it keeps going in an endless loop. in the end, my friend hasn't been able to purchase the game and there is no other way of solving this on our end. 

 

we're hoping that hopefully, you guys can fix this issue? we're not sure if other people around the world are seeing this, or we're just idiots and are going in the wrong place.

the api endpoint for determining a player's uuid given a username and timestamp (documented [here|https://wiki.vg/mojang_api#username_-.3e_uuid_at_time]) is ignoring the ""at"" parameter and only ever returning the current player with that username.

to demonstrate, here is a player that changed their name twice:
{code:java}
➜ curl ""https://api.mojang.com/user/profiles/71a75aaae2a34938850dc97c07507d97/names"" | jq

[
  {
    ""name"": ""howdydonut""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""loopykazoo"",
    ""changedtoat"": 1575342738000
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""howdydonut"",
    ""changedtoat"": 1602456240000
  }
]
{code}
 

we would then expect the following results when calling the username/time -> uuid endpoint (note that timestamps are converted from epoch millis to seconds, as required):
 * loopykazoo, 1575342738 => 200 / ok
 * howdydonut, 1575342738 => 204 / not found

however, instead, we get the following results:
 * loopykazoo, 1575342738 => 204 / not found
 * howdydonut, 1575342738 => 200 / ok

 
{code:java}
➜ curl ""https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/loopykazoo?at=1575342738"" | jq

# (no response body)

➜ curl ""https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/howdydonut?at=1575342738""

{
  ""name"": ""howdydonut"",
  ""id"": ""71a75aaae2a34938850dc97c07507d97""
}{code}
 

furthermore, i have noticed that i can pass nonsense input via the ""at"" parameter without triggering a 400 / bad request.
{code:java}
➜ curl ""https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/howdydonut?at=ayy-lmao"" | jq

{
  ""name"": ""howdydonut"",
  ""id"": ""71a75aaae2a34938850dc97c07507d97""
}
{code}
 

so it seems likely that the api is ignoring the ""at"" query parameter. that would explain why the param is not validated and the endpoint only ever returns the current uuid for the username at hand.

 ","username -> uuid at time endpoint ignoring ""at"" query parameter"

i know someone with an old account, that never set a custom skin, and his skin suddenly changed from the default steve he had based on the java hashcode of his uuid to an alex template skin today as well.

i don't know what's causing this but accounts shouldn't normally have their skins forcefully changed, so i'm reporting it as a bug. hopefully this is fixed soon and accounts will get their normal steve/alex default skins back depending on their uuid hashcode.",accounts that have never had a custom skin were set to either steve or alex recently

currently, the ?at= parameter seems to be broken, as it returns 200 (profile is found) for any timestamp provided, which shouldn't happen - for example, the account ""mcb"" seems to exist in 2010 according to the api (when i passed it the timestamp 1263146630) when in reality it was created in 2014. this issue should be fixed as there are numerous services that rely on this endpoint to provide user information, or help migrate old user records from servers.

and it's not just the website. it's the minecraft launcher as well. only this time it responds with: invalid username or password. but, it is neither a password as well as a username mistake i made. it does not matter what i change the password to(yes i even tried 987654321abcd), it will always send me this same message. 

does this mean i have to use a different vpn that secures my ip-address even when i'm not browsing? did i do something so bad that somehow my ip-address is banned lmao?

this also occurs when opening some subpages, for example [https://www.minecraft.net/updates/nether/] (although it shows a styled error page).

i am a man from turkey who is interested in minecraft. i am hoping to find a solution to my problem with this message. so this evening, while i wanted to purchase the game, i couldn't actually do it due to an error which resulted in the website of the game not loading. the version i wanted to buy was ""minecraft java edition"". firstly, i visited the main page, ""minecraft.net"" with my local link ""minecraft.net/tr-tr/"" and continued by selecting ""minecraft'ı al"" meaning ""buy minecraft"". it actually showed a variety of platforms where i selected ""pc"" as an option. inside the pc category, it showed me 2 options one being ""minecraft java edition"" (i selected minecraft java edition). after i entered that and continued to buy minecraft the next page did not load. it showed no sign of loading but simply had the description ""loading store..."". although i waited for several minutes and tried buying it from various browsers i was not able to load that page ""[https://my.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/]"". so, i am really hoping to solve this issue. it would be wonderful to have feedback so i can buy minecraft. i hope this issue can be solved. i will attach the screenshots i took while the incident was happening. i hope you mates are having a good day.

reply: 

 

my english and dutch are good enough to make a correct assumption on what it should be. my wife is also a speech pathologist, so spelling mistakes are always triple checked here. what you want it to be is: 

 
|
|
|wist je dat bijen bij de hardst werkende boeren ter wereld *horen.*|
|
|

 

you shouldn’t say “behoren” because it means “belong to” and in the beginning of the phrase you’re saying “ bij de...” here “bij” means “to”. so you would be saying something like “did you know that bees are belong to the hardest working farmers?

 

right now it literally says “did you know that bees go and whore with the hardest working farmers”. which is b.t.w. a very funny mistake!

threat:an ssl certificate associates an entity (person, organization, host, etc.) with a public key. in an ssl connection, the client authenticates the remote server using the server's certificate and extracts the public key in the certificate to establish the secure connection.

a certificate whose subject commonname or subjectaltname does not match the server fqdn offers only encryption without authentication.

please note that a false positive reporting of this vulnerability is possible in the following case:
if the common name of the certificate uses a wildcard such as *.somedomainname.com and the reverse dns resolution of the target ip is not configured. in this case there is no way for qualys to associate the wildcard common name to the ip. adding a reverse dns lookup entry to the target ip will solve this problem.

impact:a man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this vulnerability in tandem with a dns cache poisoning attack to lure the client to another server, and then steal all the encryption communication.

 

solution:please install a server certificate whose subject commonname or subjectaltname matches the server fqdn.

compliance:not applicable

 

exploitability:there is no exploitability information for this vulnerability.

 

associated malware:there is no malware information for this vulnerability.

277369,normal,4,bug,"i created a minecraft account for my child who is under 13 years of age. the system sent an email to my email address to confirm that my child has my permission to purchase minecraft.

when i click the link in the email sent to my account, it first takes me to a page where it verifies both my email address and my child's email address. after entering those addresses, it takes me to the ""verify that you're an adult"" page. that page is where i need to enter my credit card information to purchase minecraft for my child.

i provided a name (one that is available) in the ""name"" field for the minecraft profile. but when i attempt to enter my credit card details, the boxes for the credit card number, expiration date, and cvv do not accept any input. i have attempted this on both my desktop computer in chromium, and on my phone in safari. the form doesn't accept input in those fields in either browser. the only fields that accept input are the ""postal / zip code"" and ""billing country"" fields.

i desperately would like to give you my money but cannot due to this bug!

i've attached a screenshot of the page in question, along with the chrome developer tools window open after selecting ""inspect"" from the context menu after right-clicking the ""card number"" field, if that is of any help in diagnosing the problem with the form inputs.

274933,normal,4,bug,"i have no experience with other editions of minecraft, so i will mostly just list mistakes i found in the java edition column of the platform comparison table found on [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft]:

* ""split screen multiplayer"" not checked. it might require some tinkering to send keyboard input to two windows at once, but it is definitely possible. at least on linux it is, i have not researched this for other operating systems.
* ""(online multiplayer requires subscription sold separately)"": this is incorrect, only realms requires subscriptions, regular servers do not.
* ""controller/touch support"" not checked. touch support is explicitly implemented, there is an option to enable touchscreen mode. controller support depends on the controller, but that's the case for all the other devices in the list anyway. in the easiest case you just need to bind a controller button to an action like a regular key.
* ""minecraft marketplace"": it's not incorrect that minecraft java doesn't have this, but the missing checkmark makes it look like it's missing that feature, while the exact opposite is the case, there is much more community content available for it, usually even for free.
* ""downloadable content"" not checked. of course you can download content for minecraft java.
* ""official featured multiplayer servers"": having this unchecked makes it look like something negative, while in reality those are ads for servers (as far as i know impossible to remove), so not having them is usually something desirable.
* ""achievements/trophies"" not checked: either this is extreme nitpicking, because they're called ""advancements"" in the newer versions of minecraft java or this box is simply false.
* ""parental controls with xbox live or microsoft account"" not checked: this was now implemented in mcjava.

the remaining points seem correct to me, but the entire table is heavily skewed towards mcbe, by listing lots of features that mcbe has and omitting lots of features that mcjava has, like the 1.13+ commands system, datapacks, the 1.9+ combat system, the offhand, uncensored chat and pretty much everything on this page: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/java_edition_exclusive_features
on the other hand, lots of mcbe features are also omitted, which would give a better impression of the game, like the education edition features and everything on this page: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/bedrock_edition_exclusive_features

minecraft.net ignores q-factor weighting for the [{{accept-language}} header|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/http/headers/accept-language] value.

this header specifies the preferred languages in which a website should be served and the q-factors allow specifying in which order the languages are preferred. with firefox this can be set under the ""language"" setting.

for example when choosing english, else german else danish, the header might look like this:
{code}
accept-language: en,de;q=0.7,da;q=0.3
{code}

however, minecraft.net apparently completely ignores the weights and instead iterates over the languages in an arbitrary (possibly string hash code-based) order, serving danish first, then german and then english.

{{when you use resource packs with custom texture in folder +assets\minecraft\textures\gui,+}}{{ }}{{the texture will lose its *opacity map channel* and would be rather completely transparent or untransparent. *which was not a issue in lower versions.*}}

it's not a big issue that breaks game balance or makes the game unplayable, but the fact that it could break some custom resource packs should be considered.
h3. how to reproduce

1.download the resource pack provided in the attachment below

2.apply the pack

3.open up player inventory in creative mode in *minecraft 1.14.4*

i hope that would demonstrate things clear enough
h3. conclusion

since rendering the player inventory {color:#ff0000}*opacity*{color} is very unlikely to cause severe impact to framerate or any other rendering problems, i do not think this behavior is intended. i would appreciate it if the bug can be fixed in the *1.15 final release*.

we are looking to to re-introduce these endpoints so you can enjoy older version of minecraft: java edition. we are planning to work on this during the first quarter of 2022.
{panel}

old versions of minecraft are unable to use the mojang authentication system to confirm if users are premium users. this requires servers to run in offline mode allowing for cracked clients to connect to these servers. the issue can be addressed by bringing the previous authentication servers online or redirecting them.

 

server authentication:

old url: [https://login.minecraft.net/session?name=]

new url: [http://session.minecraft.net/game/joinserver.jsp?user=]

 

client authentication

old url: [http://www.minecraft.net/game/joinserver.jsp?user=]

new url: [http://session.minecraft.net/game/joinserver.jsp?user=]

 

due to these old urls not working, illegitimate account holders can connect to any beta/alpha server.

client authentication is the main url that needs to be fixed, server owners can implement their own fixes to patch authentication server-side although it would be best to fix server urls as well.

when i request this api endpoint, there are two possible outcomes:
 * *taken*: when the username is taken, the page will have a status code of 200 and its body will have information about the user with the given name. (example: [https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/mistri])
 * *available*: when the username is available, the page will have a status code of 204 and its body will be empty. (example: [https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/0182fh12])

however, there are quite a few usernames which fall under the second bullet point (""available"") but aren't actually available when i try to change my username. most of the time, these usernames are vulgar.

for example, requesting the username ""cum"" returns as 204 with no data, just like an available username would: [https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/cum]

i wanted to determine the difference between vulgar names like this and available names, so i did a bit of digging around in the console on the minecraft.net site. what i found out was, when changing a username, the same api is used, however it's also requested with an auth token for the user's account.

i tried doing the same requests with an auth token, and what i found was actually different outcomes:
 * *taken*: when the username is taken, the page will have a status code of 200 and its body will have information about the user with the given name. this is the same as before, without an auth token.
 * *available*: when the username is available, instead of returning a 204 like without an auth token, the page returns a 404 not found error. (example: [https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/0182fh12] with header ""authorization: bearer <auth token>"")
 * *banned*: when the username is vulgar, it now returns a 204 if the authorization token is present. (example: [https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/cum] with header ""authorization: bearer <auth token>"")

this makes no sense, and the version listed above (with the auth token) should be available to all users without requiring an auth token. this way, the public would easily be able to see which usernames are not usable.",mojang api only shows blocked usernames when authenticated

the skins on the servers are used for the image generation, so i know the url was correct once - but the skin is gone. i validated more skins and according to what i saw, i'm afraid several thousands skins of the whole database are lost. but why? is there a way to retrieve them? without the guarantee that mojang stores the ""old skins"" of a user as a snapshot on the mojang-servers, a database like that would not be possible anymore and the community would lose a lot... so please tell me what happened and how the future of the skins will look like.

201637,important,3,bug,"a few days ago i started to play the modpack direwolf20 on a server with some friends. today when i tried to login, first it didnt want to accept my email and password. so i changed my passwort acually a couple of times and it didn't work with any of these. a few minutes of raging after that i tried again and i just worked. so i figured out that maybe the mojang servers just have a couple of issues and that that was the reason it didn't work in first place.
now i could login into launcher and start the game. i proceeded like normal and tried to join the server which resulted in getting the the loging error ""failed to login: invalid session (try restarting your game and the launcher)"".
obviously after that i restarted my game and the launcher and tried again, but i still got the error. i restarted my pc and tried it again, but it still didn't work. i reset my router, still didn't work.
i really ran out of ideas and started to try find the same issue online, but i couldn't really find the same issue i had online and a solution for it.
again i thought maybe its just the mojang servers and not me, but my two friends had really no problems at all to join the server. i also tried to login on the mojang website and on the minecraft.net website. both worked completely fine and i could login. the weird thing i really didn't understand was, that i could login into the launcher, start the game, but was unable to join any server. at this point it just couldn't be the mojang servers.
i also tried to run a normal minecraft version without any mods, but i got the same error. i tried uninstalling minecraft and installing it again, but that didnt work either.
that's basicly what i did the last couple of hours and i just don't know what causes the error at this point and really need some help.
would be glad if someone could help here. thanks

update:
it seems like mojang is blocking specific ip ranges, which then causes the error we get. to me that's totally stupid, because the ""invalid session id"" error doens't directly lead to our ip adress being the problem. really don't know what mojang did there, but the only solution for us now is, to get another public ip which works.

ip ranges which don't work:
102.xxx.xxx.xxx
132.xxx.xxx.xxx
134.xxx.xxx.xxx
160.xxx.xxx.xxx
185.xxx.xxx.xxx

it appears that versions that have been marked as *archived* cannot be searched using _basic_ search. please use _advanced_ search if you want to search for older versions.

this functionality is not something that we can change, it is restricted by jira which is the platform we built the bug tracker on.
{panel}

could someone allow us to also search for previous snapshots of the same version in the ""affects version"" advanced search?

because i have searched for any bugs related to 'some subject' on the latest snapshot, i'd love to include previous versions in the search, but it won't allow me to select any besides the very very latest snapshot, this makes searching for bugs to prevent duplicate tickets more difficult.

if time wasn't such an issue, i would take 10 minutes to search for a bug, instead of checking the latest and only available for search version.

for example, if i search for version 17w45b as of now, it will show up, but if i search for 17w45a or 17w43b or 17w43a, it won't show up. which makes finding bugs that have been found, but not been updated to be affecting recent versions to show up.

usually searching for certain criteria will bring up a huge list of bugs, some which have been fixed, some which are only related.

going through this list takes a bunch of time, as well as usually you know that it can only have been an existing bug since some version x in the past. so you'd like to check all versions above version x, for that bug. usually including too much information in the search bar will block your query from being found, because people describe the bug in a different way as you would.

take _""kick command fails and breaks game""_ vs _""executing /kick <target> on a single player world, will result in crash.""_
therefore me searching for ""kick single player"" won't allow me to find the previous.
while if i only searched for ""kick"", there would be a huge load of bugs coming up from ancient versions.

this is why i am posting this, i would love to reduce the amount of duplicate tickets, as it also takes us time to create such a ticket. aiming for a better experience in game and on the bugtracker!

since some weeks it loads https://minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/?ref=m which is pretty annoying, because if you want to buy the game you would have clicked ""store"". additionally https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/ can be accessed without being logged in.

this makes it only harder to naviagte on the site and you have to rely on search engines to find the page you want.

tips for making awesome reports

1.submit one issue per report please, it's easier for us to follow and manage!
2.please provide a (to the point) summary of your problem. avoid one worded summaries and things like ""help!!!"".
3.the description should contain details of the problem and how to reproduce it, so that we can more easily track down the problem and try to fix it.
4.please search before creating a report to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported. if it has, please join the discussion there!
5, if you've discovered an exploit or a security issue, please create a private report that only yourself and mojang will be able to see.",not able to send private issue to 4j

158183,normal,4,bug,"h3. the problem

the wrong thumbnail is chosen for blog posts on minecraft.net - rather than using the large header image, it picks another image from within the page - usually the author's avatar (which doesn't work too well).  this did not happen with mojang.com blog posts, although it seems that that was only the case because there were few other images.

you can see this by comparing the [domain listing for minecraft.net|https://www.reddit.com/domain/minecraft.net/] ([archive|http://archive.is/1fnjw]) with the [domain listing for mojang.com|https://www.reddit.com/domain/mojang.com/] ([archive|http://archive.is/feosx]).

h3. cause

this happens because minecraft.net does not specify a thumbnail, so reddit instead picks the thumbnail automatically.  reddit prioritizes large images that are mostly square for thumbnails; the images on minecraft.net don't fit under that category.  you can see the code that reddit uses to scrape thumbnails [here|https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/da549027955c28b2e99098a22c814fc2ba729e11/r2/r2/lib/media.py#l706].

h3. fix

this can be fixed either by adding a {{<link rel=""image_src"" href=""..."">}} tag or a {{<meta property=""og:image"" content=""..."">}} tag.  the later is part of the [open graph protocol|http://ogp.me/] while the former is a special {{link}} tag used by reddit and certain other sites.  i personally would recommend using the og tag but either works.",some sites (eg reddit) use incorrect thumbnails with minecraft.net blog posts due to the lack of the apropriate <meta> tag

when the brand is null, a {{nullpointerexception}} is caught and handled, and the brand is treated as {{\~\~error\~\~ nullpointerexception: null}}.  hopper seems to be detecting that the brand is not {{vanilla}} and thus treating the server as modded, even when it isn't.

a demo of this: [mcx-3002118/77338978|http://hopper.minecraft.net/crashes/minecraft/mcx-3002118/77338978/] says:

	server type: integrated singleplayer server
...
	is modded: probably not. jar signature remains and client brand is untouched.
	type: client (map_client.txt)
{noformat}

given that the client is (most likely) unmodified, and that it's an integrated single player server, the server brand should be {{vanilla}}, but is null.  why it's null is beyond the scope of this issue, but hopper shouldn't be assuming it's modded _just_ because it's null.  while there are some modded servers that don't send a brand, it can also happen in vanilla and thus the brand being null shouldn't be used to mark an issue as modded-only.",hopper.minecraft.net inacurately treats cases where the server brand is null as a modded server

so in the new minecraft.net website, under profile, you find this sentence:

""search really hard and you might be able to find a fitting minecraft skin elsewhere on the internet.""

the main issue with that sentence is that you dont have to search hard at all to find a decent skin. it can be found in under 20 seconds, and if a skin is advertised as a 'minecraft skin' its quite logical that it can fit a minecraft character.

128669,normal,4,bug,"there are multiple ways to retrieve the uuid from a username:

{code}
post https://api.mojang.com/profiles/minecraft

[""player1"", ""player"" ...]

(same rate limit)

unfortunately, these rate limits also limit the quality of third party products, as this makes it impossible to access user data via username. i am aware that usernames should not be used for user _reliable identification_, however they are still the best way when dealing with user input (uuids not so much). e.g. 'what's your minecraft account?'

----

{code}
get https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/profile/{uuid}
{code}
the profiles api has a better approach at rate limiting: instead of limiting the _overall_ requests per time, this has a much stricter limit for a _uuid per time_. that means you can make as many requests to the api as you like, as long as you don't request the _same_ uuid within one minute.
this limit requires caching request responses, but that problem can easily be solved at the client side.

----

this issue could be fixed by applying the same kind of time + username rate limit to one of the two username endpoints.

please keep in mind that many clients will access the profile info for the username's uuid instantly upon retrieval of the former, so you may want to change or provide a new endpoint for username -> profile if that's reasonable from the api point of view.

please let me know if anything is unclear.

*obviously that is a jpeg (jfif), not {{image/png}}.*

you could correct the {{content-type}} header, but imo that's the wrong approach as pretty much everything probably expects a png here.

i attached a file with more of these, some are gif, some bmp, most are jpeg.
i'm sure there are more, however. to find them, you can query your database for blobs that don't start with the 8 magic png bytes {{89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a}}.

if that is a problem for you, i'm willing to help out a little by reporting more skins that are not png (we make a lot of requests) so you can manually fix them.

you could also solve this issue alongside web-27. you'd just make sure they're converted to png. alternatively, you could check the magic bytes when you deliver skins and simply delete them when they're not png.
i'll leave the solution up to you guys :)
